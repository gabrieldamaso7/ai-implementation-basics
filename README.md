# AI Implementation Basics

This repo contains basic/foundational exercises for building AI-powered applications using Python and APIs

## Goals
- Work comfortably with Python scripts
- Call external APIs
- Build a base for LLM-powered systems

## Setup
- Python 3.11+
- Virtual env
- Minimal dependencies

## Status
- Week 1 - Env setup complete
- Week 1 - Basic functions, dicts and validation
- Week 1 - call free API - stock price for APPLE - EOD last day of 2025
- Week 1 - Basic LLM Client
- Week 1 - Quality and read me:
    - where it fails: blank input, wrong api access key
    - outcome is broken: confusing prompt, too much information on the prompt
    - deterministic? not really
    - Cost for 10k words: input = 0.002$, output = 0.0001$ (https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/pricing)

- Task 6 - Structured LLM output with JSON parsing and validation
